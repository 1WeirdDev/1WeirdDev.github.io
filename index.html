                    <p>
                        I am a programmer and entrepreneur who has been coding for years,
                        and I have experience doing all kinds of things such as game development, website development, OS development,
                        and software development. I have experience in many programming languages such as HTML, Java, Javascript, CSS, C++, C, Python, and a few more.
                        I am a hardworker willing to work on projects for you as long as I get some form of payment.
